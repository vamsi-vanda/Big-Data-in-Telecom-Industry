HDFS needs to be setup on your machine to read and write the data. We have used Windows 10 for this purpose, but any OS can be used. You can follow the tutorial for setting up single node HDFS cluster here

Spark needs to be installed from the official Apache Spark Link

Pyspark 2.3 version has been used in the project.

PySpark Shell needs to be configured in order to run it inside Jupyter Notebook. To setup in your machine follow these instructions
